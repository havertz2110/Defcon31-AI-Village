# Defcon31-AI-Village
This is for the Defcon31 Ai Village Solution I did back in Nov/2023. I managed to solve 13/27 challenges, then a couple more after the contest :)))) 

This repo contains: challenge files,submission Excel file, Markdown file for reading the solution ( because it would look more formal to read ) and a Notebook file for coding (still have solution in that, so you can download and do it yourself).  

Feel free to contact me if I did it wrong or the writeup is unclear, thank you!
